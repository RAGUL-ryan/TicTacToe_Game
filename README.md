Project Overview:

â€¢	Developed a responsive, web-based Tic Tac Toe game for two players using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
â€¢	Implemented an intuitive and visually appealing interface with interactive elements and animations.

Steps Taken:
1.	Interface Design (HTML & CSS):

â€¢	Designed the interface with a modern, clean look using CSS, focusing on a light theme with white and soft colors.
â€¢	Added subtle animations to cells, buttons, and pop-ups to enhance the user experience.

2.	Game Logic (JavaScript):

â€¢	Developed the game logic to handle player turns, ensuring the correct symbol (X or O) is placed on the board.
â€¢	Included functionality to detect winning patterns (three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal) and declare the winner.
â€¢	Implemented a draw detection mechanism to identify when all cells are filled without a winner.
â€¢	Displayed pop-ups to inform players of the game state (win, draw, or next turn).

3.	User Interaction:

â€¢	Enabled click interactions on grid cells, allowing players to place their marks.
â€¢	Provided real-time feedback, showing which playerâ€™s turn it is and updating the game status dynamically.
â€¢	Added a restart button to reset the game for a new match.

2.	Celebration Effects:

â€¢	Integrated interactive animations with falling emojis (e.g., ðŸŽ‰, ðŸ¥³) when a player wins, creating a celebratory effect.
â€¢	Utilized CSS keyframe animations to make the emojis fall smoothly across the screen.

4.	Responsive Design:

â€¢	Ensured the game is fully responsive, making it playable on both desktop and mobile devices.
â€¢	Optimized layout and elements to adjust to different screen sizes while maintaining an attractive appearance.

5.	Styling Enhancements:
